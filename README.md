## 🎯 Business Problem

Manufacturing companies lose significant revenue due to defects. This analysis answers:
- **When** do defects occur most frequently?
- **Where** are the problem areas (lines, machines)?
- **Why** are defects happening (root causes)?
- **How much** is it costing the business?
- **What** can be done to reduce defects?

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. 🌙 Night Shift Effect
**Defect rate is 40% higher during night shifts**

| Shift | Defect Rate |
|-------|-------------|
| Morning | 2.5% |
| Afternoon | 2.8% |
| Night | **4.2%** ⚠️ |

**Root Cause:** Operator fatigue, reduced supervision
**Recommendation:** Additional quality checks, improved lighting

---

### 2. 📅 Monday Spike
**Defects increase 25% on Mondays**

**Root Cause:** Equipment calibration drift over weekend
**Recommendation:** Monday morning calibration protocol

---

### 3. ⚙️ Production Line 3 Issues
**Line 3 has 2x the defect rate of Line 1**

| Line | Defect Rate |
|------|-------------|
| Line 1 | 2.1% |
| Line 2 | 3.2% |
| Line 3 | **4.1%** ⚠️ |

**Root Cause:** Older equipment
**Recommendation:** Equipment upgrade or enhanced maintenance

---

### 4. 🔧 Machine Maintenance Needed
Machines **M007, M008, M009** have significantly higher defect rates.

**Recommendation:** Immediate preventive maintenance

---

### 5. 💰 Cost Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Production | 198,000+ units |
| Total Defects | 5,800+ units |
| Overall Defect Rate | 2.94% |
| **Annual Defect Cost** | **₹29.2 Lakhs** |
| Potential Savings | ₹8-10 Lakhs |
| **ROI of Recommendations** | **180%+** |
